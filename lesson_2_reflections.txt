What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
By initializaling a repository a simple directory or folder converts into a git repository by adding a file .git in the folder 
which possibly contains the settings and history details of each file in the repository.
If we don't initialize a repository then it will be a simple directory and no git commands work on that directory and concept of 
version control fails.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the intermediate stage between working directory and repository as it offers the user to save that files 
that have one logical change. It is abstract directory not visible to the user. User cannot access the contents of the staging area directly.
